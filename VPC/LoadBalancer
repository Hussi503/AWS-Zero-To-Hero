An Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that efficiently and automatically distributes incoming traffic across a group 
of backend servers. This distribution increases speed and performance, improving the scalability and security of your applications. The ELB allows you to configure
health checks for the registered targets. If any of the registered targets (such as those in an Auto Scaling group) fail the health check, the load balancer will not
route traffic to the unhealthy target, ensuring your application remains highly available and fault-tolerant.
